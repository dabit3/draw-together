## Draw together

### Getting started

1. Clone the app, install dependencies (NPM and iOS or Android Modules)

2. Get an API key from [Fal.ai](https://fal.ai)

3. Create `credentials.ts` file with `FAL_CREDENTIALS` as API key (for production, ship a proxy server instead of using credentials from the client)

4. Start the server

```sh
npm start
```

5. Run the app

```sh
npm run ios

# or

npm run android
```
